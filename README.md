# HPC-OpenGL Repository

This repository documents my journey in High Performance Computing (HPC) using OpenGL, showcasing a progression of projects exploring various graphics and computational concepts.
## Requirements
- GLFW:  This is to generate the window. My goal is to learn OpenGL and not waste time one genrating windows therefor this library comes in handy.
```
  sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev
```
- GLAD: This is to load the opengl from drivers.
- Guid to setup both on [windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4F0tI7WlDs)
- Guid to setup both on [Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxEFn-cGdE0)
